# NoteTaker-Long-GT-FT


<hr>

This project was created for the intents and purposes of performing express backend functions in order to retrive note data from a JSON file. The objective of the project was for the user to be able to generate a Note Taker app with GET,POST, and DELETE functions using express. Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Utilize npm packages to generate the paths and file systems
<li> Making use of the GET, POST, and DELETE methods to generate our own API calls.
<li> Troubleshooting errors along the way

</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).
